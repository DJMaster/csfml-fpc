  \brief Change the source texture of a convex shape

  The \a texture argument refers to a texture that must
  exist as long as the shape uses it. Indeed, the shape
  doesn't store its own copy of the texture, but rather keeps
  a pointer to the one that you passed to this function.
  If the source texture is destroyed and the shape tries to
  use it, the behaviour is undefined.
  \a texture can be NULL to disable texturing.
  If \a resetRect is true, the TextureRect property of
  the shape is automatically adjusted to the size of the new
  texture. If it is false, the texture rect is left unchanged.

  \param shape     Shape object
  \param texture   New texture
  \param resetRect Should the texture rect be reset to the size of the new texture?

  \brief Set the sub-rectangle of the texture that a convex shape will display

  The texture rect is useful when you don't want to display
  the whole texture, but rather a part of it.
  By default, the texture rect covers the entire texture.

  \brief Set the fill color of a convex shape

  This color is modulated (multiplied) with the shape's
  texture if any. It can be used to colorize the shape,
  or change its global opacity.
  You can use sfTransparent to make the inside of
  the shape transparent, and have the outline alone.
  By default, the shape's fill color is opaque white.

  entity in the entity's coordinate system.
